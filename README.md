In [this](https://github.com/jaiisrani/fusion/blob/main/trajectories_homogenous_cartesian.m) program, I use ode45 solver in MATLAB to solve the set of differential equations describing trajectories of a charged particle in a homogenous magnetic field. The differential equations are none else but Lorentz's law that have been derived manually from the Lagrangian using Euler-Lagrange equations in Cartesian coordinates. Quantities of interest such as $x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z$ can be plotted upon modifying line 13 of my code.
